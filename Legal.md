# App Store & Play Store Requirements

## 1. Mandatory Requirements for App Stores

Both Apple and Google require specific links that must be accessible **outside the app**.

### Privacy Policy URL
- **Mandatory**
- You cannot submit an app without a public link that explains how you handle user data.

### How to Submit an App to App Store and Play Store

### Complete Store Listing
- **Short Description:** Up to 80 characters
- **Full Description:** Up to 4,000 characters
- **Category:** Choose correct type (App/Game)
- ...

**Sofrik**

### Support URL
- You must provide a link where users can find contact information or help if:
    - The app crashes
    - There are payment issues

### Data Deletion Request URL
- Modern privacy laws (**GDPR, CCPA**) require a public link where users can request their account to be deleted.
- This must work **without necessarily being logged into the app**.

## 2. Developer Account Requirements

### Google Play (Organization Account)
- If you register as a **Company** (not Individual), Google requires:
    - An official **website URL** for the business.

### Apple Developer Program
- You can enroll as an **Individual** without a website.
- However, having a domain helps you:
    - Create professional email addresses (e.g., `support@playnxt.com`)
    - Increase the chances of passing **App Review**.

## 3. Deep Linking & App Clips (Technical)

### Android App Links / iOS Universal Links
- To allow users to click a link (e.g., in WhatsApp) and open the app directly:
    - You **must own a domain**
    - The domain hosts a **Digital Asset Link** file proving app ownership.

### Group Sharing
- Feature: *"Should be able to share the Group to WhatsApp"*
- Without a domain:
    - Shared content is just a raw text code.
- With a domain:
    - It becomes a **clickable link**
    - Can directly open the app.

    - Publish a public Notion page for:
        - Privacy Policy
        - Rules

    - Host multiple required links in one place:
        - Support
        - Privacy
        - Terms
